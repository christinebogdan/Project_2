# Reservia | Travel Website

## Description

Reservia is a website offering a vacation planning tool. Their site allows users to find accommodations and activities in the city of their choice. Accommodations can also be filtered.

Aim of the project was to **turn mockups into a webpage**. Mockups for the Reservia Travel Website were provided for desktop and mobile, as well as a logo and all images. In addition to building the site, I had to make my own adaptions for a tablet layout and determine suitable breakpoints.

## Objectives

- text of **search input field can be edited** by the user (search button not functional)
- all accommodation or activity **cards are clickable** in their entirety (links are empty)
- on hover, **filter buttons change their appearance** (filters not functional)
- accommodations and activities **nav elements are anchor links** leading to respective section of page
  The website content can be divided into **three parts**.
