# Reservia | Travel Website

## Description

<<<<<<< HEAD
Aim of the project was to **turn mockups into a webpage**. Mockups for the Reservia Travel Website were provided for desktop and mobile, as well as a logo and all images. In addition to building the site, I had to make my own adaptions for a tablet layout and determine suitable breakpoints.

The website content can be divided into **three parts**.

1. The navigation
1. The search input field and filter buttons
1. The main content
   1. Most Popular
   1. Accommodations
   1. Activities
